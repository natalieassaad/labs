        "and in the future will likely easily be found at \\texttt{data.gov}. Some highlights include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- CDC WONDER API for Data Query Web Service: Includes death certificates with causes since approximately the 1990's.\n",
        "- Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS): Housing and Urban Development (HUD) maintains an API that provides Census data on housing problems and needs unavailable through other sources, including IPUMS.\n",
        "- Federal Election Commission API: Provides historical and up to the minute campaign finance data.\n",
        "- Toxic Release Inventory: Provided by the Environmental Protection Agency, this API documents the release and management of over 800 toxic substances, reported annually by privately owned facilities and the government.\n",
        "- Petroleum Data, Prices: Provides prices of petroleum products and crude oil at weekly, monthly, and yearly time scales.\n",
        "- Fair Market Rents Lookup tool: Fair Market Rents (FMRs) determine the value of housing vouchers for Section 8 renters. This API provides the FMR values and other measures of housing affordability.\n",
        "- Annual Economic Surveys, Business Patterns: Surveys of businesses at the zip code level, tracking economic sentiment and activity.\n",
        "- Food Access Research Atlas: Provides spatial data on food access and the availability of supermarkets within census tracts. Can be merged with census data to look at under-served populations and food deserts.\n",
        "- National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration: Provides API access to data on real time weather and climate change projections.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each of these API resources could either be the cornerstone of a project or a source of additional data. These data sources have a number of advantages: They're free, most of them can be accessed using the same API key, and most have similar documentation for how to write a query. This is ideal for students to iterate, experiment, and take risks, with little cost to failure.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to government data, many commerical apps provide API access to developers and researchers. AirBnB, Amazon, Reddit, eBay, X, and many others maintain API access to develop third-party apps. These opportunities present many advantages: The data are larger, have more variety, and there are vastly many more cases. Building a third-party app that includes analytics could easily consume an entire semester and open a variety of applications in predictive analytics, natural language processing, and generative AI (e.g. predict which reviews are fake or real for Amazon for a product group like ``women's watches', and then make recommendations for different price points). While an exciting possibility, this can also raise a lot of problems: Some API's cost money or are rate-limited depending on a subscription, and others impose significant constraints on how the data can be used. In some cases, a more useful approach might be explicit web scraping using a package like BeautifulSoup or Selenium. For example, Craigslist has no API, but can easily and productively be scraped using BeautifulSoup.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Pick an API, download some data, wrangle them, and produce some EDA results, as we did in the previous steps with the saferproducts.gov API; or, if you can't get it to work, document why. If you have the time and it's low cost, push the results to a streamlit page. If you have had enough, I recommend https://www.eia.gov/opendata/browser/electricity, since there is a friendly query builder that you can use to learn.**"
