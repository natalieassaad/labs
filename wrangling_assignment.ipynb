    "RESPONSES:\n",
    "1. This paper discusses how data cleaning is an integral part of data science/analysis, and tidy datasets are a significant component in this process. A tidy dataset requires each variable to be a column, each observation a row, and each type of observational unit to be a table. Structuring the data in this way, according to Wickham, makes it easier to create tools to input/output this kind of data and perform analyses.\n",
    "2. The \"tidy data standard\" is intended to make data cleaning easier and more efficient by producing a standard organization for datasets - making it easier to produce/use tools for data analysis.\n",
    "3. The first sentence suggests that because messy datasets are unique in their structure/problems, it is easier to deal with tidy datasets that are all similar in order to make meaning out of the data. The second sentence describes how it may be simple to discern a row (observation) from a column (variable) in a dataset, but making comparisons or relationships between observations and variables can be difficult.\n",
    "4. Wickham explains that a dataset is a collection of values where a value is either a number or string that belongs to a variable. A variable is the collection of values measuring the same attribute (e.g., height). An observation is the values measured on the same unit across attributes (e.g., a person).\n",
    "5. In tidy data, each variable makes a column, each observation makes a row, and each type of observational unit makes a table.\n",
    "6. The five most common problems with messy datasets are (1) column headers are values instead of variable names, (2) multiple variables are stored in one column, (3) variables are stored in both rows and columns, (4) multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table, and (5) a single observational unit is stored in multiple tables. The data in Table 4 are messy because the column headers are actually values instead of variable names. In other words, the variables need to be transformed into their own columns (i.e., religion, income, and frequency need to be the three column headers in this dataset). This process is called melting - where columns are turned into rows. To melt this data, we would want to make income and frequency into their own columns. This results in a long dataset with each row being a type of religion, range of income, and frequency of values.\n",
    "7. Table 11 is a messy dataset because some column headers are values instead of variable names (e.g., \"d1\", \"d2\"... are values instead of variables) and there are multiple variables stored in one column (e.g., \"element\" stores both tmax and tmin). Table 12a melts this data by making the days values into a single \"date\" variable. A new column for \"value\" is also created. However, this is still not tidy because the \"element\" column does not contain values. In Table 12b, the values from the previous \"element\" column are split into two separate variables - \"tmax\" and \"tmin.\" This dataset is now tidy since each observation is a row and each variable is a column.\n",
    "8. The \"chicken-and-the-egg\" problem with tidy data is that tidy data is only as useful as the tools that come with it, but this therefore makes tidy tools linked to tidy data itself. Since tidy tools are designed to work specifically with tidy data, the two are consequently dependent on each other. For example, changing only the tidy tools may not make these processes more efficient as this would also require changing the tidy data structure. Wickham hopes that the tidy data framework will be a starting point for data scientists to build more efficient processes/tools for wrangling data, even outside of the concept of tidying."
